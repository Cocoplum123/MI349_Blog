<h2>Restaurant Week Event - Pistolera Mexican Cantina</h2>
   <p>Oct/10/2020    By Wu Jin</p>
<p>Recently, a three-week restaurant week was held in Shanghai, China. I went to a few of these restaurants. The reason I went to this one was that I hadn't eaten Mexican food for a long time. So I was thinking about how to taste the Mexican food in Shanghai compared to what I had in the US during the restaurant week.</p>
<p>The first dish is the Mexican nachos, which is also very common in the United States. It is also served with guacamole and diced tomatoes.</p>

<p>The second one is today’s drink, a mango margarita using an environmentally friendly straw.</p>

<p>Next is the fragrant fried dumplings, which are said to be traditional Mexican dumplings. This is the first time I have eaten it. The stuffing is spinach and mushrooms, but I don’t think I have tasted these two things.</p>
<p><img src="fried dumplings.jpg" alt="fried dumplings"></p>
<p>Next is today's main dish, three flavors of taco. The three flavors of taco are rib-eye steak, fried shrimp, and tilapia. I think these three tacos are very delicious, which is a little different from the taco I usually eat. I think it is a combination of Chinese tastes.</p>

<p>Finally, I came to the dessert mango coconut mousse, which was beautifully presented and delicious. The only drawback was that the white chocolate on top was poor.</p>
