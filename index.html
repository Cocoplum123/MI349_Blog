        <h2>Restaurant Week Event - Pistolera Mexican Cantina</h2> 
        <time datetime="2020-10-06" title="October 6, 2020"> Oct 06, 2020</time>
        <p>
          Recently, a three-week restaurant week was held in Shanghai, China. I went to a few of these restaurants. The reason I went to this one was that I hadn't eaten Mexican food for a long time. So I was thinking about how to taste the Mexican food in Shanghai compared to what I had in the US during the restaurant week.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first dish is the Mexican nachos, which is also very common in the United States. It is also served with guacamole and diced tomatoes.
        </p>
        <p><img alt="nachos" src="nachos.jpg" width="800" class = "img"></p>
        <p>The second one is today’s drink, a mango margarita using an environmentally friendly straw.</p>
        <p><img alt="margarita" src="margarita.jpg" width="800" class = "img"></p>
        <p>Next is the fragrant fried dumplings, which are said to be traditional Mexican dumplings. This is the first time I have eaten it. The stuffing is spinach and mushrooms, but I don’t think I have tasted these two things.</p>
        <p><img alt="fried dumplings" src="FriedDumplings.jpg" width="800" class = "img"></p>
        <p>Next is today's main dish, three flavors of taco. The three flavors of taco are rib-eye steak, fried shrimp, and tilapia. I think these three tacos are very delicious, which is a little different from the taco I usually eat. I think it is a combination of Chinese tastes.</p>
        <p><img alt="tacos" src="tacos.jpg" width="800" class = "img"> </p>
        <p>Finally, I came to the dessert mango coconut mousse, which was beautifully presented and delicious. The only drawback was that the white chocolate on top was poor.</p>
